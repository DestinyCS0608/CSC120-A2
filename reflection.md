What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Honestly this assignment was very hard to do. OOP is a new process for me so I had to watch a lot of videos to understand it. ( I still feel like I don't understand it). I think what worked best for me was first dividing up which methods and functions best belonged in each class definitions. And from there doing psuedocode to plan out how to formulate the methods. Looking at the proedural programming code also help and was a good hint for making the code OOP friendly. 

I would tell future students taking this class to watch some videos prior to starting the assignment. And ask questions!!!
